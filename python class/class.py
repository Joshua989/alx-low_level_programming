#The given code defines two classes: `parent` and `child`, which demonstrates the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming. Here's an explanation with comments:


class parent:
  def funct1(self):
    print("this is function 1")

  class child(parent):  # The child class inherits from the parent class.
    def funct2(self):
      print("this is function 2")

# Object part
ob = child()  # Creating an instance of the child class.

ob.funct1()  # Calling the funct1() method of the parent class using the child object.
ob.funct2()  # Calling the funct2() method of the child class using the child object.
```

#Explanation:
#- The `parent` class has a single method `funct1()` which simply prints "this is function 1" when called.
#- The `child` class is defined inside the `parent` class, indicating that it is a nested class. The child class inherits from the parent class, which means it can access and use the methods and attributes of the parent class.
#- The `child` class has a single method `funct2()` which also prints "this is function 2" when called.
#- In the object part, an instance of the `child` class is created and assigned #to the variable `ob`.
#- `ob.funct1()` calls the `funct1()` method inherited from the `parent` class, printing "this is function 1".
#- `ob.funct2()` calls the `funct2()` method defined in the `child` class, printing "this is function 2".

#In summary, this code demonstrates the inheritance relationship between the `parent` and `child` classes, where the child class inherits the functionality of the parent class and can also have its own additional methods.
